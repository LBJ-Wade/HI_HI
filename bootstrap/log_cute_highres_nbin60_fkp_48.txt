*** Reading run parameters 

*** Setting z-distance relation from the cosmology:
 - Omega_M = 0.315 
 - Omega_L = 0.685 
 - w       = -1.000   

*** 3D correlation function (pi,sigma): 
 - Range: (0.000,0.000) < (pi,sigma) < (60.000,20.000) Mpc/h
 - #bins: (60,20)
 - Resolution: d(pi) = 1.000 Mpc/h
   Log. binning in sigma with 0 bins per decade
 - Using a brute-force approach 

*** Reading catalog from file data_48.txt

  The average redshift is 0.024941
  Effective n. of particles: 40.742589

*** Boxing catalogs 
  There will be (10,14,3) = 420 boxes in total
  Boxes will be (dx,dy,dz) = (14.629,15.790,15.541) 
  There are objects in 207 out of 420 boxes 
  There are objects in 257 out of 420 boxes 

*** Correlating 
 - D-D 
Node 0 : 207 iters, will take from 0 to 207
    Relative time ellapsed 48.3 ms
 - D-R 
Node 0 : 207 iters, will take from 0 to 207
    Relative time ellapsed 6125.3 ms
 - R-R 
Node 0 : 257 iters, will take from 0 to 257
    Relative time ellapsed 99968.0 ms
